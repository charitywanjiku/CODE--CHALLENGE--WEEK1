#### DESCRIPTION
This repository contains phase-1,week-1 code challenges.You are required to write down solutions using javascript thus practicing javascript.Afterwards you create separate javascript files for each of the named challenges above.

##### CHALLENGE1:Student Grade Generator.(Toy Problem.)
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks.The input should be between 0 and 100.Then output the correct grade:
a>79,B-60 to 79,C-59 to 49,D -40 to 49, E-LESS 40.
###### CHALLENGE2:Speed Detector.(Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the sped of a caree e.g 80.If the speed is less than 70,it should print "Ok".Otherwise,for every 5km/s above the speed limit(70),it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerits points e.g
if the speed is 80,it should print:"Points:2";If the driver gets more than 12points,the function should print:"License suspended".
###### CHALLENGE3:Net  Salary :(Toy Problem)
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an indivual's Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.Calculate the payee(i.e Tax),NHIFDeductions.NSSFDeductions,gross,salary and net salary1
